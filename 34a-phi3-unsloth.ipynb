    "# Finetune a Phi 3.5 model with ~ 4 billion parameters using LoRA\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a self-curated dataset with [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) as a basis. The whole dataset is available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/Cornell-University/arxiv). The dataset was filtered to have either `LLM` (only as a whole word), `Large Language Model`, `GRPO` or `GSPO` in the title of the abstract. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the following system prompt:\n",
    "```\n",
    "You are an educated researcher and always answer in correct scientific terms.\n",
    "You are very deep into LLMs and its methodologies. You are very creative.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model should learn how to write abstracts about a certain topic. An example user prompt would be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Write an abstract with the title 'Few-shot training LLMs for project-specific code-summarization'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The example abstract is taken from arXiv, so the answer will be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Very large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and Codex have achieved\n",
    "state-of-the-art performance on several natural-language tasks, and show great\n",
    "promise also for code. A particularly exciting aspect of LLMs is their knack\n",
    "for few-shot and zero-shot learning: they can learn to perform a task with very\n",
    "few examples. Few-shotting has particular synergies in software engineering,\n",
    "where there are a lot of phenomena (identifier names, APIs, terminology, coding\n",
    "patterns) that are known to be highly project-specific. However,\n",
    "project-specific data can be quite limited, especially early in the history of\n",
    "a project; thus the few-shot learning capacity of LLMs might be very relevant.\n",
    "In this paper, we investigate the use few-shot training with the very large GPT\n",
    "(Generative Pre-trained Transformer) Codex model, and find evidence suggesting\n",
    "that one can significantly surpass state-of-the-art models for\n",
    "code-summarization, leveraging project-specific training.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If finetuning works, we will observe that the models know about `GRPO` which\n",
    "was introduced *after* the knowledge cutoff. Moreover, the models should adhere\n",
    "to the format and scientific language of the abstract.\n",
